### Group Members
The members of group 5 are Kelin Lyu (Deze Lyu), Felix Zhang (Futian Zhang), Jackie Li (Mengxuan Li), Kelvin Yu (Kangming Yu), and Zifan Zhang.

### Project Description
We are developing a 3D multiplayer FPS game, similar to CSGO and Overwatch. The game is team-based and round-based. The players must cooperate with their teammates and eliminate the entire enemy team to win in every round. The team that wins the most rounds wins the game, and the other side loses. The most exciting part of our game is that each player can shoot both bullets and portals. Each player can create up to two portals. Players can see through the portals to observe the other side of the map. Then, they can shoot or move through the portals created by themselves, their teammates, and even their enemies. In addition to the portals, each player is equipped with a pair of gravity boots, allowing them to walk on any surface and change their orientation after moving from one surface to another. For a complete list of the gameâ€™s features, please see the Project Schedule, which sorts the features we are about to make with priority from high to low.
