# Overcross - UCSD CSE125 Group5 Project
A 3D multiplayer FPS game...[More details coming soon!]

## Developers
Kelin Lyu (Deze Lyu), Felix Zhang (Futian Zhang), Jackie Li (Mengxuan Li), Kelvin Yu (Kangming Yu), and Zifan Zhang.

## Milestone #1
A simple but powerful OpenGL engine prototype has been developed! Here is a quick tutorial:
##### Requirements
First, you need to add the GLFW, GLEW, GLM libraries, and the Assimp library for loading models.
Next, add the Engine (Overcross/Overcross/Engine) folder and all the files inside to your project.
Then, prepare your game assets. Since our project uses PNG image files and DAE 3D model files, only these formats are tested. After that, you need to put all the assets under the same directory as the executable. You can either do that manually or write a short script that copies the resources before building the executable.
